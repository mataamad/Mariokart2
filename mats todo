block diagrams explaining how things work

do things:
write up in detail about the student board control and progress so far
write 'psuedo' code for student board that will do the correct control. organize the directory structure.
check code comments
documentation. Take pictures.  how to make things work. problems. hardware problems.
sticky labels with A-A B-B arrows on them, cover unused ports.
organize all directories
make a todo list for future years
reduce the speed poll rate on the motor board
organize student board directory
save motor driver datasheets
update API so it's 0-256 (well less than that) for acceleration setting
